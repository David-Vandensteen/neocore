## Description

Demonstrates a complete bullet system with player control and asteroid targets, showcasing modular code organization.

## Features Demonstrated

- **Modular Design**: Separate modules for player and asteroid systems
- **Bullet Management**: Projectile system with collision detection
- **Game Loop Structure**: Clean separation of init, display, and update phases

## Key Functions Used

- `player_init()` - Initialize player system
- `asteroid_init()` - Initialize asteroid system
- `player_display()` - Render player graphics
- `asteroid_display()` - Render asteroid graphics
- `player_update()` - Update player logic
- `asteroid_update()` - Update asteroid logic

## Code Architecture

### Modular Structure
- **player.h/player.c**: Player character management
- **asteroid.h/asteroid.c**: Asteroid system management
- **main.c**: Core game loop coordination

### Game Loop Pattern
1. **Initialization**: `init()` - Set up all game systems
2. **Display**: `display()` - Render all visual elements
3. **Update Loop**: Continuous `update()` calls within main loop

## What You'll See

- Player character positioned at (100, 100)
- Asteroid system active on screen
- Bullet projectiles (implementation dependent on player/asteroid modules)
- Interactive gameplay elements

## Technical Details

- Clean separation of concerns with dedicated modules
- Centralized initialization and update coordination
- Scalable architecture for adding more game systems
- Mathematical calculations using `<math.h>` for advanced projectile physics

## Learning Objectives

This sample teaches:
- How to organize larger NeoCore projects with multiple modules
- Implementing proper game loop architecture
- Creating reusable game system components
- Managing inter-system communication and dependencies
- Scaling NeoCore applications beyond simple demos
