# Sprite Manager Test Sample

## Description

Test sample for validating sprite manager functionality and sprite allocation system.

## Features Demonstrated

- **Sprite Manager Testing**: Validation of sprite allocation system
- **Memory Management**: Testing sprite creation and destruction
- **System Limits**: Testing sprite capacity and boundary conditions
- **Error Handling**: Validation of error conditions and edge cases

## Key Functions Used

- Sprite manager allocation functions
- Sprite creation and destruction routines
- Memory management validation
- System limit testing

## Test Coverage

### Basic Operations
- Sprite allocation and deallocation
- Index management and tracking
- Memory usage validation

### Edge Cases
- Maximum sprite capacity testing
- Invalid parameter handling
- Resource cleanup validation

### Performance
- Allocation speed testing
- Memory fragmentation checks
- System stability under load

## What You'll See

- Test results and validation output
- Sprite allocation statistics
- Error condition testing
- Performance metrics

## Learning Objectives

This sample teaches:
- How to test sprite management systems
- Understanding sprite allocation limits
- Debugging sprite-related issues
- Performance testing methodologies
- System validation techniques

## Technical Notes

This is primarily a testing/validation sample rather than a demonstration sample. It's used to ensure the sprite manager system works correctly under various conditions.
