# code_snippet
## Summary
The code snippet consists of several functions that are used to move different types of graphics elements. These functions take in parameters such as the graphics element to be moved and the amount of offset to apply in the x and y directions. The functions then update the position of the graphics element accordingly.

## Example Usage
```c
// Move a GFX_Picture_Physic by an offset of 10 in the x direction and 5 in the y direction
GFX_Picture_Physic gfx_picture_physic;
move_gfx_picture_physic(&gfx_picture_physic, 10, 5);

// Move a GFX_Animated_Sprite_Physic by an offset of -3 in the x direction and 8 in the y direction
GFX_Animated_Sprite_Physic gfx_animated_sprite_physic;
move_gfx_animated_sprite_physic(&gfx_animated_sprite_physic, -3, 8);

// Move a GFX_Animated_Sprite by an offset of 2 in the x direction and -4 in the y direction
GFX_Animated_Sprite gfx_animated_sprite;
move_gfx_animated_sprite(&gfx_animated_sprite, 2, -4);

// Move a GFX_Picture by an offset of -7 in the x direction and 0 in the y direction
GFX_Picture gfx_picture;
move_gfx_picture(&gfx_picture, -7, 0);

// Move a GFX_Scroller by an offset of 1 in the x direction and 3 in the y direction
GFX_Scroller gfx_scroller;
move_gfx_scroller(&gfx_scroller, 1, 3);
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `gfx_picture_physic`: A pointer to a `GFX_Picture_Physic` structure representing a physical picture element.
- `gfx_animated_sprite_physic`: A pointer to a `GFX_Animated_Sprite_Physic` structure representing a physical animated sprite element.
- `gfx_animated_sprite`: A pointer to a `GFX_Animated_Sprite` structure representing an animated sprite element.
- `gfx_picture`: A pointer to a `GFX_Picture` structure representing a picture element.
- `gfx_scroller`: A pointer to a `GFX_Scroller` structure representing a scroller element.
- `x_offset`: The amount of offset to apply in the x direction.
- `y_offset`: The amount of offset to apply in the y direction.
___
### Flow
- The `move_gfx_picture_physic` function takes in a `GFX_Picture_Physic` structure and applies the given `x_offset` and `y_offset` to move the picture element. It also updates the bounding box of the picture element if the `autobox_enabled` flag is set.
- The `move_gfx_animated_sprite_physic` function takes in a `GFX_Animated_Sprite_Physic` structure and applies the given `x_offset` and `y_offset` to move the animated sprite element. It also updates the bounding box of the animated sprite element.
- The `move_gfx_animated_sprite` function takes in a `GFX_Animated_Sprite` structure and applies the given `x_offset` and `y_offset` to move the animated sprite element.
- The `move_gfx_picture` function takes in a `GFX_Picture` structure and applies the given `x` and `y` coordinates to move the picture element.
- The `move_gfx_scroller` function takes in a `GFX_Scroller` structure and applies the given `x` and `y` coordinates to move the scroller element.
___
### Outputs
- The functions update the position of the graphics elements based on the given offsets.
- The `move_gfx_picture_physic` function also updates the bounding box of the picture element if the `autobox_enabled` flag is set.
