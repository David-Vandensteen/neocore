# code_snippet
## Summary
The code snippet defines functions for getting and setting the position of various types of graphics objects, such as animated sprites, pictures, and scrollers. It also includes deprecated versions of these functions.

## Example Usage
```c
GFX_Animated_Sprite sprite;
GFX_Animated_Sprite_Physic spritePhysic;
GFX_Picture picture;
GFX_Picture_Physic picturePhysic;
GFX_Scroller scroller;

// Get the x and y positions of a GFX_Animated_Sprite
short x = get_x_gfx_animated_sprite(sprite);
short y = get_y_gfx_animated_sprite(sprite);

// Get the x and y positions of a GFX_Animated_Sprite_Physic
short xPhysic = get_x_gfx_animated_sprite_physic(spritePhysic);
short yPhysic = get_y_gfx_animated_sprite_physic(spritePhysic);

// Get the x and y positions of a GFX_Picture
short xPicture = get_x_gfx_picture(picture);
short yPicture = get_y_gfx_picture(picture);

// Get the x and y positions of a GFX_Picture_Physic
short xPicturePhysic = get_x_gfx_picture_physic(picturePhysic);
short yPicturePhysic = get_y_gfx_picture_physic(picturePhysic);

// Get the x and y positions of a GFX_Scroller
short xScroller = get_x_gfx_scroller(scroller);
short yScroller = get_y_gfx_scroller(scroller);

// Set the x position of a GFX_Animated_Sprite_Physic
set_x_gfx_animated_sprite_physic(&spritePhysic, 100);

// Set the y position of a GFX_Animated_Sprite_Physic
set_y_gfx_animated_sprite_physic(&spritePhysic, 200);

// Set the x position of a GFX_Scroller
set_x_gfx_scroller(&scroller, 300);

// Set the y position of a GFX_Scroller
set_y_gfx_scroller(&scroller, 400);

// Set the position of a GFX_Scroller using a Vec2short
Vec2short position = {500, 600};
set_position_gfx_scroller(&scroller, position);

// Set the position of a GFX_Animated_Sprite using a Vec2short
set_position_gfx_animated_sprite(&sprite, position);

// Set the position of a GFX_Picture using a Vec2short
set_position_gfx_picture(&picture, position);

// Set the position of a GFX_Picture_Physic using a Vec2short
set_position_gfx_picture_physic(&picturePhysic, position);
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `GFX_Animated_Sprite`: A structure representing an animated sprite.
- `GFX_Animated_Sprite_Physic`: A structure representing a physics-enabled animated sprite.
- `GFX_Picture`: A structure representing a picture.
- `GFX_Picture_Physic`: A structure representing a physics-enabled picture.
- `GFX_Scroller`: A structure representing a scroller.
- `Vec2short`: A structure representing a 2D vector of shorts.
___
### Flow
- The code snippet defines functions for getting the x and y positions of various types of graphics objects.
- There are separate functions for each type of object, as well as deprecated versions of these functions.
- The functions use the corresponding data structures to access the position values.
- There are also functions for setting the x and y positions of physics-enabled objects and scrollers.
- The functions take pointers to the objects and update their position values accordingly.
- Additionally, there are functions for setting the position of objects using a Vec2short structure.
- These functions update the position values of the objects and perform additional operations if necessary.
___
### Outputs
- `short`: The x and y positions of the graphics objects.
- `void`: The functions for setting the positions do not return any value.
