# code_snippet
## Summary
The code snippet defines several functions for hiding and showing different types of graphics elements.

## Example Usage
```c
// Hide a GFX_Picture
hide_gfx_picture(&picture);

// Hide a GFX_Picture_Physic
hide_gfx_picture_physic(&picture_physic);

// Hide a GFX_Animated_Sprite_Physic
hide_gfx_animated_sprite_physic(&animated_sprite_physic);

// Hide a GFX_Animated_Sprite
hide_gfx_animated_sprite(&animated_sprite);

// Show a GFX_Animated_Sprite
show_gfx_animated_sprite(&animated_sprite);

// Show a GFX_Animated_Sprite_Physic
show_gfx_animated_sprite_physic(&animated_sprite_physic);

// Show a GFX_Picture
show_gfx_picture(&picture);

// Show a GFX_Picture_Physic
show_gfx_picture_physic(&picture_physic);
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `gfx_picture`: A pointer to a `GFX_Picture` structure.
- `gfx_picture_physic`: A pointer to a `GFX_Picture_Physic` structure.
- `gfx_animated_sprite_physic`: A pointer to a `GFX_Animated_Sprite_Physic` structure.
- `animated_sprite`: A pointer to a `GFX_Animated_Sprite` structure.
___
### Flow
- `hide_gfx_picture`: Hides the picture by calling the `pictureHide` function with the `pictureDAT` member of the `gfx_picture` structure.
- `hide_gfx_picture_physic`: Hides the picture by calling the `pictureHide` function with the `pictureDAT` member of the `gfx_picture_physic` structure.
- `hide_gfx_animated_sprite_physic`: Hides the animated sprite by calling the `hide_gas` function with the `gfx_animated_sprite` member of the `gfx_animated_sprite_physic` structure.
- `hide_gfx_animated_sprite`: Hides the animated sprite by calling the `aSpriteHide` function with the `aSpriteDAT` member of the `animated_sprite` structure. It also clears the sprites using the `clearSprites` function.
- `show_gfx_animated_sprite`: Shows the animated sprite by calling the `aSpriteShow` function with the `aSpriteDAT` member of the `gfx_animated_sprite` structure.
- `show_gfx_animated_sprite_physic`: Shows the animated sprite by calling the `aSpriteShow` function with the `aSpriteDAT` member of the `gfx_animated_sprite_physic` structure.
- `show_gfx_picture`: Shows the picture by calling the `pictureShow` function with the `pictureDAT` member of the `gfx_picture` structure.
- `show_gfx_picture_physic`: Shows the picture by calling the `pictureShow` function with the `pictureDAT` member of the `gfx_picture_physic` structure.
