# code_snippet
## Summary
The code snippet is a set of functions related to an ADPCM player. It includes functions to initialize the player, retrieve a pointer to the player, push remaining frames to the player, and update the player's state.

## Example Usage
```c
init_adpcm();
Adpcm_player *player = get_adpcm_player();
push_remaining_frame_adpcm_player(10);
update_adpcm_player();
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
The code snippet does not take any inputs directly. However, it assumes that the ADPCM player has been properly initialized before calling the functions.
___
### Flow
- The `init_adpcm` function initializes the ADPCM player.
- The `get_adpcm_player` function returns a pointer to the ADPCM player.
- The `push_remaining_frame_adpcm_player` function takes a frame count as input and adds it to the remaining frames of the ADPCM player. It also sets the player's state to "PLAYING".
- The `update_adpcm_player` function checks if there are remaining frames in the player. If there are, it sets the player's state to "PLAYING" and decreases the remaining frame count by 1. If the remaining frame count becomes zero, the player's state is set to "IDLE".
___
### Outputs
The code snippet does not have any explicit outputs. However, the functions modify the state of the ADPCM player, which can be accessed through the returned pointer from `get_adpcm_player`.
