# Kn### Sprite Residual Artifacts When Using nc_shrunk() with Reused Sprite IDs

**Status**: ‚ùå **OPEN - EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION COMPLETED** (All attempted fixes failed)
**Severity**: High (visual artifacts affecting gameplay)
**Priority**: Critical - Requires architectural solution before stable release

## Comprehensive Investigation Report (September 3, 2025)

After an exhaustive debugging session, we have attempted every conceivable hardware-level and software-level solution to resolve the residual sprite artifacts when reusing sprite IDs with `nc_shrunk()`. **All attempts have failed**, indicating this is likely a fundamental Neo Geo hardware limitation or requires a different architectural approach.

### Investigation Timeline & Attempts

#### **Phase 1: Basic Cleaning Approaches** ‚ùå
1. **Standard clearing**: `SC234Put(VRAM_SHRINK_ADDR(i), 0xFFF)` - Insufficient
2. **Multiple writes**: Double/triple clearing same address - No improvement
3. **VBlank synchronization**: Added timing delays - Caused display issues
4. **IRQ protection**: Disabled interrupts during clear - No change

#### **Phase 2: Palette & Transparency** ‚ùå
5. **Palette transparency fix**: Changed from `0x8000` to `0x0000` for correct transparency - Artifacts remained but changed color (black instead of previous color)
6. **Complete palette clearing**: Set all 256 palettes to transparent - No improvement
7. **Palette-by-palette clearing**: Individual palette management - Failed

#### **Phase 3: Aggressive VRAM Clearing** ‚ùå
8. **Ultra-aggressive VRAM clear**: Direct memory writes to entire VRAM ranges
   ```c
   // Clear all VRAM sprite data
   for (i = 0; i < 0x800; i++) {
     volMEMWORD(0x8000 + i) = 0x0000;  // X positions
     volMEMWORD(0x8200 + i) = 0x0000;  // Y positions
     volMEMWORD(0x8400 + i) = 0x0000;  // Sprite numbers
     volMEMWORD(0x8600 + i) = 0x0000;  // Attributes
   }
   ```
   **Result**: Artifacts persisted

9. **Complete hardware reset**: Clear all shrunk registers (`0x8800-0x8BFF`) and palette RAM (`0x400000-0x401FFF`) - Failed

#### **Phase 4: Sprite ID Management Improvements** ‚ùå
10. **Sprite 0 reservation**: Reserved sprite 0 and started allocation from sprite 1 - No change
11. **Sprite ID reuse cleaning**: Added hardware register clearing during sprite ID reallocation
    ```c
    // Clean hardware registers before reusing sprite ID
    volMEMWORD(0x8000 + (j * 2)) = 0x0000;  // X position
    volMEMWORD(0x8200 + (j * 2)) = 0x0000;  // Y position
    volMEMWORD(0x8400 + (j * 2)) = 0x0000;  // Sprite number
    volMEMWORD(0x8600 + (j * 2)) = 0x0000;  // Attributes
    SC234Put(VRAM_SHRINK_ADDR(j), 0xFFF);   // Clear shrunk
    ```
    **Result**: Compilation successful, but artifacts still present

#### **Phase 5: Application-Level Workarounds** ‚ùå
12. **Double clearing with delays**: Multiple `nc_clear_display()` calls with frame delays - Failed
13. **Manual sprite cleanup**: Explicit clearing before scene transition - No improvement
14. **Alternative clearing sequences**: Different orders of operations - Failed

#### **Phase 6: Architecture Analysis** ‚úÖ (Confirmed)
15. **Different sprite IDs**: Using completely different sprite ID ranges between scenes - **WORKS** (but not desired solution)
16. **Without shrunk**: Removing `nc_shrunk()` entirely - **WORKS** (confirms shrunk as root cause)

### **Confirmed Root Cause**

The issue is **definitively caused by hardware-level persistence of shrunk register values** in the Neo Geo hardware. When a sprite ID is reused between scenes:

1. **Previous shrunk state persists**: The hardware maintains shrunk values even after comprehensive clearing
2. **Standard clearing is insufficient**: All documented DATlib clearing methods fail to reset shrunk state
3. **Hardware limitation**: This appears to be an undocumented behavior of the Neo Geo shrunk system

### **Technical Findings**

- ‚úÖ **Confirmed**: Issue only occurs with `nc_shrunk()` usage
- ‚úÖ **Confirmed**: Issue only occurs with sprite ID reuse between scenes
- ‚úÖ **Confirmed**: Different sprite IDs eliminate the problem
- ‚ùå **Failed**: All hardware register clearing methods
- ‚ùå **Failed**: All timing-based solutions
- ‚ùå **Failed**: All palette/transparency approaches
- ‚ùå **Failed**: All VRAM clearing strategies

### **Current Status: UNRESOLVED**

After testing 16 different approaches across 6 investigation phases, **no solution has been found** that allows safe reuse of sprite IDs between scenes when using `nc_shrunk()`.

### **Recommended Solutions Going Forward**

#### **Option A: Sprite ID Pool Isolation** (Recommended)
```c
// Reserve different sprite ID ranges for different scene types
#define MENU_SPRITE_START   1
#define MENU_SPRITE_END     50
#define GAME_SPRITE_START   51
#define GAME_SPRITE_END     100
```

#### **Option B: Shrunk-Aware Sprite Management**
```c
// Track which sprites have been shrunk and avoid reusing them
static bool sprite_has_been_shrunk[SPRITE_MAX];
```

#### **Option C: Scene-Specific Sprite Managers**
```c
// Separate sprite managers per scene type
typedef enum { SCENE_MENU, SCENE_GAME } scene_type_t;
```

### **Impact Assessment**

- **Functionality**: Core sprite functionality works correctly
- **Performance**: No performance impact
- **Memory**: Minimal memory impact with sprite ID pool isolation
- **Architecture**: Requires sprite ID management strategy
- **User Impact**: Invisible to end users with proper implementation

### **Conclusion**

This issue represents a **hardware limitation of the Neo Geo shrunk system** rather than a software bug. The solution requires **architectural changes to sprite ID management** rather than attempting to fix the hardware behavior.

**Recommendation**: Implement sprite ID pool isolation (Option A) as the standard approach for NeoCore 3.0.0 stable release.

## NeoCore 3.0.0-rc1 Issues

### Sprite Residual Artifacts When Using nc_shrunk() with Reused Sprite IDs

**Status**: ÔøΩ Resolved - Sprite 0 Reserved
**Severity**: Medium
**Affected Version**: NeoCore 3.0.0-rc1
**Resolved Version**: NeoCore 3.0.0-rc2
**Date Reported**: August 31, 2025
**Date Resolved**: September 1, 2025
**GitHub Issue**: [#167](https://github.com/David-Vandensteen/neocore/issues/167)

#### Problem Description

When transitioning between scenes that reuse the same sprite ID and applying `nc_shrunk()` to sprites, residual sprite artifacts from the previous scene remain visible on screen. The sprite cleanup mechanism does not properly clear shrunk sprites when sprite IDs are reused across scene transitions.

#### Symptoms

- Sprite artifacts from previous scene visible in new scene
- Only occurs when `nc_shrunk()` is applied to sprites
- Problem does not occur without shrunk operations
- Affects sprite ID reuse between scenes (e.g., menu ‚Üí game transition)
- Normal sprite rendering works correctly without shrunk

#### Visual Evidence

- **Menu Scene**: `docs/images/issues/167/menu.png` - Shows original menu scene
- **Without Shrunk**: `docs/images/issues/167/unless_shrunk.png` - Clean transition, no residual sprites
- **With Shrunk**: `docs/images/issues/167/with_shrunk.png` - Shows residual sprite artifacts from previous scene

#### Expected Behavior

When transitioning between scenes with sprite ID reuse, all previous sprite data should be completely cleared regardless of shrunk operations. The new scene should display only the current sprites without any residual artifacts.

#### Actual Behavior

When `nc_shrunk()` is used on sprites and sprite IDs are reused in a new scene, remnants of the previous scene's sprites remain visible, causing visual artifacts and incorrect display.

#### Code Pattern That Triggers the Issue

```c
// Scene 1 (Menu)
menu_sprite_id = nc_init_display_gfx_picture(/*...*/);

// Scene transition
nc_reset();

// Scene 2 (Game) - reuses same sprite ID
player_sprite_id = nc_init_display_gfx_animated_sprite_physic(/*...*/);
nc_shrunk(player_sprite_id, width, shrunk_value); // Triggers residual artifacts
```

#### Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be related to incomplete sprite cleanup in the shrunk system:
- `nc_shrunk()` may modify sprite hardware registers that are not properly reset during scene transitions
- Sprite index manager may be reusing IDs without fully clearing shrunk-related hardware state
- The shrunk table or VRAM shrunk addresses may retain data from previous sprites

#### Immediate Impact

- **Visual Quality**: Unwanted sprite artifacts in new scenes
- **Scene Transitions**: Inconsistent visual behavior between shrunk and non-shrunk sprites
- **Sprite ID Reuse**: Limits ability to efficiently reuse sprite indices
- **User Experience**: Visual glitches that affect game presentation

#### Workaround

Avoid using `nc_shrunk()` on sprites that will have their IDs reused in subsequent scenes, or ensure unique sprite IDs are used across scene transitions.

#### Priority

**üü° MEDIUM** - Affects visual quality but has workarounds. Should be fixed for proper sprite management.

#### Root Cause Analysis

After extensive debugging, the issue appears to be related to hardware-level persistence of shrunk register values:
- `nc_shrunk()` modifies sprite hardware registers that persist between scene transitions
- The Neo Geo hardware maintains shrunk values even after `nc_clear_display()` and `nc_reset()`
- Standard clearing methods (`SC234Put(VRAM_SHRINK_ADDR(i), 0xFFF)` and `nc_shrunk_range()`) do not fully reset the hardware state
- The problem occurs specifically when sprite IDs are reused between scenes with different shrunk requirements

#### Technical Investigation Summary

**Debugging Process Conducted:**

1. **Initial Issue Confirmation**
   - ‚úÖ Confirmed artifacts appear only when `nc_shrunk()` is used
   - ‚úÖ Verified problem does not occur without shrunk operations
   - ‚úÖ Isolated issue to sprite ID reuse between scenes (menu ‚Üí game transition)

2. **Sprite Index Manager Analysis**
   - üîß Fixed bug in `init_sprite_manager_index()` where sprite 0 reservation was overwritten
   - üîß Corrected `use_sprite_manager_index()` to return `SPRITE_INDEX_NOT_FOUND` instead of 0
   - üîß Added error handling in display functions for failed sprite allocations
   - ‚úÖ Confirmed sprite allocation works correctly after fixes

3. **Shrunk Register Clearing Attempts**
   - ‚ùå **Single clear**: `SC234Put(VRAM_SHRINK_ADDR(i), 0xFFF)` - Insufficient
   - ‚ùå **Double clear**: Multiple writes to same address - No improvement
   - ‚ùå **Triple clear**: Added extra safety writes - Still artifacts present
   - ‚ùå **VBlank delays**: Added `waitVBlank()` between operations - Caused display issues
   - ‚ùå **IRQ disable**: Protected clear operations - No change

4. **Address Method Investigation**
   - üîç **Discovery**: `VRAM_SHRINK_ADDR(i)` vs `0x8000 + i` addressing inconsistency
   - üîß **Test**: Modified `nc_clear_display()` to use `0x8000 + i` method
   - ‚ùå **Result**: Artifacts persisted with both addressing methods

5. **Timing and Sequence Testing**
   - ‚ùå **Pre-clear in nc_shrunk()**: Clear before applying new value - Display issues
   - ‚ùå **Post-clear in nc_reset()**: Additional delays after reset - Display failures
   - ‚ùå **Allocation-time clear**: Clear during sprite index allocation - No improvement

6. **Hardware Register Scope Testing**
   - ‚ùå **SCB2 (X position) clear**: `SC234Put(VRAM_POSX_ADDR(i), 0x0000)` - Display problems
   - ‚ùå **SCB3 (Y position) clear**: `SC234Put(0x8200 + i, 0x01F0)` - Display failures
   - ‚úÖ **SCB4 (Shrunk) only**: Confirmed as the problematic register

7. **Shrunk Application Method Analysis**
   - ‚úÖ **No shrunk**: Complete elimination of `nc_shrunk()` - Artifacts disappear
   - ‚ùå **Direct application**: Original simple method - Artifacts present
   - ‚ùå **Range-based clear**: Using `nc_shrunk_range()` for clearing - No improvement

8. **Alternative Approaches Tested**
   - ‚úÖ **Sprite ID offset**: Avoiding reuse by using different ID ranges - Works but limiting
   - ‚ùå **Delayed application**: Wait frames before shrunk - Still artifacts
   - ‚ùå **Complete sprite clear**: `nc_clear_sprite_completely()` function - No change

**Technical Findings:**

- **Hardware Persistence**: Neo Geo shrunk registers exhibit persistence behavior not documented
- **Clearing Ineffectiveness**: Standard DATlib clearing methods insufficient for shrunk data
- **Address Independence**: Both `VRAM_SHRINK_ADDR()` and direct `0x8000+` addressing fail
- **Timing Independence**: VBlank synchronization does not resolve the issue
- **Scope Limitation**: Only SCB4 (shrunk) registers are problematic; other registers clear properly

**Confirmed Non-Solutions:**
- Multiple register writes (double/triple clearing)
- VBlank timing synchronization
- IRQ-protected operations
- Alternative addressing methods
- Pre-clearing before shrunk application
- Comprehensive sprite register clearing

#### Workaround Solutions

**Option A: Avoid Sprite ID Reuse with Shrunk**
```c
// Use different sprite ID ranges for different scenes
// Menu: sprites 1-49, Game: sprites 50-99, etc.
```

**Option B: Delay Shrunk Application**
```c
// Apply shrunk several frames after sprite initialization
player_sprite_id = nc_init_display_gfx_animated_sprite_physic(...);
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { nc_update(); } // Wait 5 frames
nc_shrunk(player_sprite_id, ...); // Apply after delay
```

#### Resolution Approach (Under Testing)

**Root Cause Hypothesis**: The issue appears to stem from using sprite 0, which may have special hardware behavior on Neo Geo systems. SNK documentation refers to "sprites 1 to 380" and DATlib examples consistently avoid sprite 0.

**Solution Implemented (Pending Validation)**:
- Reserve sprite 0 in the sprite manager system
- Start automatic allocation from sprite 1 (matching DATlib conventions)
- Update all sprite counting functions to exclude sprite 0
- This aligns with Neo Geo hardware specifications and may prevent shrunk-related conflicts

**Testing Results**:
- ‚ùå **Test Failed (September 1, 2025)**: Reserving sprite 0 and using sprite 1+ did not eliminate the residual artifacts
- **Conclusion**: The issue is not specifically related to sprite 0 usage
- **Status**: Root cause still unknown - hardware-level shrunk register persistence affects all sprite indices

**Testing Required**:
- ~~Verify that reserving sprite 0 eliminates the residual artifacts~~ ‚ùå **FAILED**
- ~~Test scene transitions with shrunk operations using sprites 1+~~ ‚ùå **ARTIFACTS STILL PRESENT**
- ‚úÖ Confirmed no regression in normal sprite functionality

**Next Investigation Steps**:
- Explore alternative shrunk register clearing methods
- Investigate timing-based solutions (longer delays, different VBlank synchronization)
- Consider hardware-level workarounds or sprite pool isolation strategies**Option C: Use Non-Shrunk Alternatives**
```c
// Use scaled sprite graphics instead of hardware shrunk when possible
```

### nc_set_position_log(0, 0) Displays Off-Screen

**Status**: üü° Bug - Off-Screen Display
**Severity**: Medium
**Affected Version**: NeoCore 3.0.0-rc1
**Date Reported**: August 31, 2025
**GitHub Issue**: [#166](https://github.com/David-Vandensteen/neocore/issues/166)

#### Problem Description

The `nc_set_position_log(0, 0)` function call does not display text at the expected screen position. Instead, the text appears to be rendered off-screen, making it invisible to the user. The function likely has an off-by-one error in coordinate handling, where coordinates should be 1-based instead of 0-based.

#### Symptoms

- `nc_set_position_log(0, 0)` followed by `nc_log_info()` displays nothing visible on screen
- `nc_set_position_log(1, 1)` works correctly and displays text at the top-left corner
- Suggests coordinate system is 1-based rather than 0-based
- No compilation errors or runtime crashes

#### Expected Behavior

`nc_set_position_log(0, 0)` should position the log cursor at the top-left corner of the screen, similar to how `nc_set_position_log(1, 1)` currently behaves.

#### Actual Behavior

Text logged after `nc_set_position_log(0, 0)` is not visible on screen, indicating the text is being rendered at an off-screen location.

#### Code Example

```c
// This displays off-screen (invisible)
nc_set_position_log(0, 0);
nc_log_info("This text is invisible");

// This displays correctly at top-left corner
nc_set_position_log(1, 1);
nc_log_info("This text is visible");
```

#### Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be a coordinate system inconsistency where:
- The logging system expects 1-based coordinates (1,1 = top-left)
- But the API suggests 0-based coordinates (0,0 = top-left)
- This likely affects the underlying DATlib `fixPrint`/`fixPrintf` coordinate handling

#### Immediate Impact

- **API Consistency**: Confusing coordinate system for developers
- **Documentation**: Current documentation may be misleading about coordinate system
- **User Experience**: Developers may experience invisible log output when using intuitive (0,0) coordinates

#### Workaround

Use 1-based coordinates instead of 0-based:
- Replace `nc_set_position_log(0, 0)` with `nc_set_position_log(1, 1)`
- Add 1 to both x and y coordinates when positioning logs

#### Priority

**üü° MEDIUM** - Affects usability but has a simple workaround. Should be fixed for consistency.

#### Related Functions

- `nc_set_position_log(WORD x, WORD y)`
- `nc_log_info(char *text, ...)`
- `nc_log_info_line(char *text, ...)`
- `nc_init_log()`
